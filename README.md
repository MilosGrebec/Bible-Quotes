Bible Quotes is a small React Native app made using Expo.

Currently the only supported languages are Serbian and English, but in the near future I plan to add more languages.

Also, the currently supported OS is only Android. Even if it's made in React-Native, I currently don't have an iOS device for testing and debugging, so for now, the only supported OS is Android.

The first time you open Bible Quotes, it generates a random number, and then based on that random number, the app shuffles the array of quotes, and every day it shows you different quotes from that array.

In the "near" future there will be more quotes, more languages, and more OS support, but the UI of the app will not change, so there will be a Serbian version, an English version, etc.

Here is how the app looks now:
